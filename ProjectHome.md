Estimation is a trick-based card game. Playing this game is very intricate and very concentration intensive, because a player is expected to keep track of many things that goes on a long the duration of the play: cards dealt, calls placed, highest score holders and where they are seated, cards played during a hand, and finally a strategy that the player follows and to recognize when to adapt and change to a different strategy based on certain unexpected change of one or more game variable.

The ultimate goal of the game is for a player to gain the highest score by the end of the last hand. This can be achieved by collecting exactly the amount of tricks he called for each hand during the bid.

This card game will be developed with portability in mind, but our first target is Android platform.
